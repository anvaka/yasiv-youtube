Unfortunately YouTube decided that this project does not align with their terms per
[policy I.1](https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/developer-policies#i.-additional-prohibitions):

> I. Additional Prohibitions
>
> ...
>
> You and your API Clients must not, and must not encourage, enable, or require others to:
>
> 1. use YouTube API Services to create, offer, or act as a substitute for, or substantially 
> similar service to, any YouTube Applications. API Clients must not mimic or replicate
> YouTube's core user experiences by recreating features or process flows unless they add 
> significant independent value or functionality that improves users' interactions with YouTube. 
> For example, an API Client must not recreate the browse experience from any YouTube Application
> without adding significant independent value to that flow.

While I disagree with this statement - seeing network of YouTube videos is not possible on YouTube itself
I have no power to overrule their verdict.

It was a fun project and you can see how it used to renders graph of related YouTube videos:
